# Farmers Market 

This is a reimplementation of my (very unfinished) game, using C++ and SFML instead of Go and Pixel. I figured it was worth at least trying the standard tools for the job.

See [here](https://github.com/sgoedecke/farmers-market) for my attempt in Go.

## Usage

`make` should build an executable called `game`
